    What Do I Want This Website To Do:
- I want it to be easy to add to it, so it should be like a template
and I can just add new sections by copying and pasting
- Responsive: when I add it should be in the right section without me doing anything

    What Info I Want Clear:
- Sections should be based on total time to get there, hike, and get back
- Afternoon Hikes
- Weekend Hikes
- Backpacking
- Cabins

    Trail Info
- Name of Trail & mileage
- My Rating
- Parking Location [link to directions] & Drive Time
- Pictures
- Notes/Comments
